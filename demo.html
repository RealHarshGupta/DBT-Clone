                        <P>The remarkable march of India into the world of bio-sciences and technological advances began
                            in 1986. That year, the then Prime Minister of the country, late Rajiv Gandhi accepted the
                            vision that unless India created a separate Department for Biotechnology, within the
                            Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India the country would not progress to
                            the desired extent. This was because many of our macro-economic issues of growth were
                            subsumed within that scienceâ€™s development.
